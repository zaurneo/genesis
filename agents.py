# agents.py - STREAMLINED 6-AGENT SYSTEM with Technical Lead Authority
"""
Streamlined 6-Agent System for Enterprise Code Development:
1. Code Architect - Designs project structure and architecture
2. Code Writer - Writes, fixes, and improves ALL code (ONLY code writer)
3. Code Executor - Executes code and monitors performance
4. Technical Lead - Experienced leader who guides, challenges, and validates all work
5. Task Manager - Tracks all tasks in table format, updates only per tech lead directives
6. Documentation Writer - Creates comprehensive documentation

ENHANCED: Technical Lead has authority and oversight over all agents
STREAMLINED: Writer handles both creation and fixing, removing redundant agents
