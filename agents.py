# agents.py - Enhanced Multi-Agent Code Development System
"""
Enhanced 7-Agent System for Enterprise Code Development:
1. Code Architect - Designs project structure and architecture
2. Code Writer - Writes clean, functional code  
3. Code Executor - Executes code and monitors performance
4. Error Analyzer - Analyzes errors and identifies root causes
5. Code Fixer - Fixes errors and improves code quality
6. Quality Checker - Ensures code quality, security, and best practices
7. Documentation Writer - Creates comprehensive documentation

Based on the proven patterns from the stock analysis project.
