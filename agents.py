# ðŸ”¹ Difference between Python variable name and the `name` argument:
# - The Python variable name (e.g., `stock_data_node`) is just for referencing the node in your code.
#   It has no effect on the execution, memory, or message labeling.
# 
# - The `name` argument (e.g., `name="stock_data_fetcher"`) is used to label the agent's messages
#   within the chat history. It identifies **who** said what, and is essential for memory,
#   logging, and handoffs between agents.
#   Best practice: keep both names aligned for clarity and debugging.
